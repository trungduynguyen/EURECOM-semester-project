      <direction>When the turkey is done, transfer it to a serving platter to rest and set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Pour the pan drippings into a 1-quart glass measure, medium bowl, or gravy separator.</direction>
      <direction>Leave any browned bits in the bottom of the roasting pan.</direction>
      <direction>Let stand for 5 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Using a large spoon, skim the clear yellow fat that rises to the surface and reserve (or pour fat out of separator into another bowl).</direction>
      <direction>If the drippings don't seem dark enough, pour half back into the roasting pan and set over two burners.</direction>
      <direction>Bring to a boil over high heat.</direction>
      <direction>As the drippings reduce they will darken.</direction>
      <direction>Pour in the remaining drippings until the liquid in the pan is as dark as you want.</direction>
      <direction>The amount of drippings will decrease, but the finished gravy will be darker and taste better without having to resort to something from a bottle.</direction>
      <direction>Remove browned drippings and Add enough stock to the drippings to measure 4 cups total cooking liquid.</direction>
      <direction>set aside Set the roasting pan on top of the stove over 2 burners on moderately low heat.</direction>
      <direction>Add 6 tablespoons of the reserved fat to the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisking constantly.</direction>
      <direction>Let the mixture bubble, whisking constantly, until it browns, 1 to 2 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>It is important to let the mixture cook for a minute or two to allow the flour to lose its raw taste, but adjust the heat as needed to keep it from burning.</direction>
      <direction>Whisk in the cooking liquid, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, whisking occasionally.</direction>
      <direction>If the gravy seems too thin, increase the heat to medium and boil until it is as thick as you wish.</direction>
      <direction>If desired, strain the gravy through a wire sieve to remove any extraneous bits of drippings.</direction>

      <direction>Coat tilapia fillets lightly, but thoroughly with corn meal and Old Bay mixture.</direction>
      <direction>Lay coated fillets in hot olive oil (medium-medium high heat) and cook until golden on the bottom, then turn fillets over and repeat.</direction>
      <direction>Do not overcook the fish--it's easy to do.</direction>
      <direction>While fillets are cooking, combine Miracle Whip, sweet relish, and lemon juice and stir until well blended, then serve with the fish.</direction>
      <direction>It's quick, easy, and doesn't require a lot of cleanup.</direction>
      <direction>Steamed carrots or broccoli and some form of potatoes go well with this.</direction>

      <direction>If doing the night before, cover and leave on the counter.</direction>
      <direction>You can also do this the night before, or just before cooking: in a small bowl, beat the eggs then stir in the milk and oil, and vanilla if using.</direction>
      <direction>If doing this the night before, cover and store in the fridge.</direction>
      <direction>When ready to cook, pour the liquid mixture (stir well again if taking it straight from the fridge) into the flour mixture; stir quickly with a fork until the ingredients are moistened but the batter is still lumpy.</direction>
      <direction>Lightly grease a frying pan with a lid, like an electric frying pan.</direction>
      <direction>Pour the batter on to the hot surface-- about a quarter of a cup for each pancake.</direction>
      <direction>Cover and cook until the surface loses its wet look and bubbles have formed.</direction>
      <direction>Flip the pancakes over and cook, uncovered, about two or three minutes longer, or until the underside is browned.</direction>
      <direction>Keep warm in a low oven until all pancakes are cooked.</direction>
      <direction>Makes approximately 24 pancakes; should serve four to six with leftovers; we love leftover pancakes at my house.</direction>
      <direction>Best served with warmed real maple syrup, although I am also a big fan of blueberry syrup.</direction>

      <direction>When the turkey is done, transfer it to a serving platter to rest and set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Pour the pan drippings into a 1-quart glass measure, medium bowl, or gravy separator.</direction>
      <direction>Leave any browned bits in the bottom of the roasting pan.</direction>
      <direction>Let stand for 5 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Using a large spoon, skim the clear yellow fat that rises to the surface and reserve (or pour fat out of separator into another bowl).</direction>
      <direction>If the drippings don't seem dark enough, pour half back into the roasting pan and set over two burners.</direction>
      <direction>Bring to a boil over high heat.</direction>
      <direction>As the drippings reduce they will darken.</direction>
      <direction>Pour in the remaining drippings until the liquid in the pan is as dark as you want.</direction>
      <direction>The amount of drippings will decrease, but the finished gravy will be darker and taste better without having to resort to something from a bottle.</direction>
      <direction>Remove browned drippings and Add enough stock to the drippings to measure 4 cups total cooking liquid.</direction>
      <direction>set aside Set the roasting pan on top of the stove over 2 burners on moderately low heat.</direction>
      <direction>Add 6 tablespoons of the reserved fat to the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisking constantly.</direction>
      <direction>Let the mixture bubble, whisking constantly, until it browns, 1 to 2 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>It is important to let the mixture cook for a minute or two to allow the flour to lose its raw taste, but adjust the heat as needed to keep it from burning.</direction>
      <direction>Whisk in the cooking liquid, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, whisking occasionally.</direction>
      <direction>If the gravy seems too thin, increase the heat to medium and boil until it is as thick as you wish.</direction>
      <direction>If desired, strain the gravy through a wire sieve to remove any extraneous bits of drippings.</direction>

      <ingredient>1.23 ml  thyme leaves, dried</ingredient>

      <ingredient>0 to taste heavy aluminum foil</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Preheat oven to 275deg.</direction>
      <direction>NOTE: 3/14 This will be salty. If you would like to reduce the saltiness of your corned beef before baking, please follow this recipe recommendations recipe#361142.</direction>
      <direction>NOTE: *If your corned beef does not include a flavor packet add 2 T peppercorns and 1/2 T coriander seeds to the dried seasonings listed above.</direction>
      <direction>Combine the flavor packet with other dried ingredients. Using a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle, grind to desired texture. I prefer medium or med-fine. Set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Rinse corned beef brisket well with cold water. Pat dry.</direction>
      <direction>Get out your 9 x 13 baking dish.</direction>
      <direction>Tear off a large sheet of HEAVY aluminum foil, enough to wrap,  tent and enclose the corned beef.</direction>
      <direction>Place the corned beef on the foil, in a baking dish,  fat side up.</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle with seasoning mix and pat into the brisket.</direction>
      <direction>Bring the foil up &amp; around the corned beef, do not close up the foil.</direction>
      <direction>Bake, unwrapped, for 2 hours.</direction>
      <direction>After 2 hours, wrap the brisket tightly and tenting the foil but sealing it for the remainder of the time, an additional 2 hours.  Feel free to check and make sure there is moisture in the foil, re-wrap and continue baking. Approximate baking time is 1 1/5 hours per pound. It may take longer depending on desired level of tenderness.</direction>
      <direction>Bake to an internal temperature of 185deg. Check for tenderness. Continue baking until the brisket is fork tender. It may take additional time depending on the thickness of the brisket.</direction>
      <direction>Allow the meat to rest before slicing. Cut against the grain.</direction>
      <direction>I prefer to use an electric knife to get nice thin slices.</direction>
      <direction>Serve with horseradish, a hearty rye bread, Colleen's Colcanon potatoes, and Irish Soda bread (see suggestions in the intro).</direction>
      <direction>Enjoy!</direction>

    <serving>1</serving>
    <list_ingredient>
      <ingredient>709.77 ml  white bread flour, not wholewheat (750 ml)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>2.46 ml  instant yeast</ingredient>
      <ingredient>2.46 ml  sugar</ingredient>
      <ingredient>9.85 ml  salt</ingredient>
      <ingredient>12-13 fluid ounce  water (415 ml, original recipe said 1 5/8ths cup, which was extremely difficult to get right)</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>*** Since first making this bread according to the original instructions (which caused a lot of mess), I've simplified the process. I have now bought a fairly deep plastic bowl with sloping edges, so it has a smallish bottom. The plastic seems almost -- not quite -- non-stick, and this is the method I use now:.</direction>
      <direction>In such a lightly greased plastic bowl, put the flour, and add the yeast, sugar and salt. You may want to add less salt, but we found the original amount (1 1/4 teaspoon) not enough. Mix through.</direction>
      <direction>Add the water and stir the lot through until well mixed to a nice, smooth, quite sloppy dough.</direction>
      <direction>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put a kitchen terry towel or two over the top as well. Stand in a draught-free place for 18 hours.</direction>
      <direction>For me it works best to mix this up at 3pm. This means the dough is ready at 9am the next morning and I don't even have to get up early like my grandmother did to bake those huge farm loaves in the old days.</direction>
      <direction>After 18 hours the dough should be puffy and have little bubble holes on top and have more or less doubled in size, but don't worry too much about that.</direction>
      <direction>Instead of -- as the original recipe said -- turning out the dough on to a towel, do the following: From the sides of the bowl, scrape the dough away with light movements and fold it over on itself with floury fingers. Turn the bowl round and round, flattening the dough by repeating this "folding over". LIGHTLY press a little flatter.</direction>
      <direction>Cover bowl with same (now messy) plastic used before, and same terry towels.</direction>
      <direction>Leave to rise again -- 2 hours long.</direction>
      <direction>Half an hour before the 2 hours are up, put your oven on 450 deg F/220 deg Celsius. (I find that in my convection - fan - oven I can use a slightly lower heat: 215 - 210C, but the difference is not important).</direction>
      <direction>At the same time you need a heavy pot WITH a fitting lid, and this will go into the cold, heating-up oven, empty. The lid is to keep in the steam and cause that wonderful crust to form.</direction>
      <direction>Nothing beats an iron pot. Le Creuset will do too, and ceramic has been mentioned.</direction>
      <direction>I use a non-stick oval-shaped iron pot with a domed lid. You do NOT need a "6 - 8 quart pot" (sounds crazy to me) as stated in the original recipe. It's a small bread. My iron pot is a 2 1/2 quart pot, which translates to roughly 2 1/2 litres as well.</direction>
      <direction>I grease the pot and lid with REAL butter, and sometimes I slosh in some olive oil. I don't know why, but I feel I should do it. Now PUT THE POT IN THE OVEN, lid on.</direction>
      <direction>After the 2 hours of the 2nd rising, and when the oven and pot has reached its correct heat, take out that piping hot pot very carefully (I put it on one of my oven grids on a granite surface next to the oven).</direction>
      <direction>Have the covered dough nearby, and a silicone or other spatula. Tilt the plastic bowl over the smoking pot (don't let it touch the very hot pot) and with spatula or fingers scrape the dough lightly and evenly into the hot pot. It will sizzle as it falls into the pot; don't worry about that.</direction>
      <direction>Shake the pot slightly to distribute the dough, put on the lid, and carefully shove the whole shebang into the hot oven.</direction>
      <direction>Bake 30 minutes with lid, then open oven and take off lid. Bake 15 - 30 minutes more, until your bread has a golden crust. I find that about 15 - 20 minutes after taking off the lid the bread is ready. Baking times will differ because ovens differ.</direction>
      <direction>Turn out, and swallow that saliva until it's just cooled enough so you can saw off the end part to eat with real butter. On your own.</direction>
      <direction>When cold, do not put in plastic bag. Use a paper bag at most. I simply turn it on to the cut side on the breadboard, and cover it with a kitchen towel. It lasts until it's been eaten, which doesn't take long. Do not refrigerate, which would be silly.</direction>
      <direction>***A few points: 1. Z-mail me for questions 2. Your experience might be "messier" than mine; it depends on the consistency of the dough and the bowl you use. But greasing the bowl right at the start does help. 3. Keep to the hours mentioned. It's meant to be a sloooow rising process. 4. Be careful not to burn yourself! 5.I have just found, praise the angels, a wonderful, very fine stone-milled 100% organic flour, and have just put a loaf of that, for the first time, in the oven! I think this robust, Frenchified loaf just cries out for stone-milled flour, fine and creamy or almost white. 6. You could use 2 1/2 cups white bread flour + 1/2 cup fine rye flour. DO NOT USE wholewheat flour for this bread, except for maybe a handful: it does not have enough gluten for this bread.</direction>
      <direction>Good luck!</direction>
      <direction>And a warning, added months later: that pot you use MUST go into the oven empty, and must heat to the heat of the oven. I tried putting the dough in a cold pot yesterday, and the bread wasn't as successful. It didn't rise nearly as much, and didn't have that lovely artisanal cracked round top. So HEAT THE POT as instructed.</direction>
      <direction>MAKING A LARGER LOAF: The warning here is that I use my metric cups and spoons for this, which are very accurate! Fortunately I have a Pyrex measuring cup with both metric millilitres and Imperial fluid ounces, so I could measure the water absolutely equally.</direction>
      <direction>4 x 250 ml flour, or 1 litre or 4 cups (1 quart).</direction>
      <direction>3/4 teaspoon yeast, and stir into flour.</direction>
      <direction>3/4 teaspoon sugar, stir into flour.</direction>
      <direction>15 ml or 3 teaspoons salt.</direction>
      <direction>600 ml or 19 fluid oz water (JUST under 2 1/2 American cups -- maybe 2 teaspoons less than 2 1/2 cups).</direction>
      <direction>(EDITED June 2008): My husband actually calculated -- I'm bad with maths! -- that the water should be 666 ml  --  so add a dash more than 600 ml if you feel it's necessary. Just remember to bake this 2nd, larger recipe for the full hour. Also, he said the bread needed more salt. We don't eat a lot of salt and I'm not worried about the issue, so I now use 4 teaspoons, i.e. 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon).</direction>
      <direction>Best results are still with white bread flour, stone-milled, or all-purpose, and a little rye flour can be used too.</direction>
      <direction>Carry on as usual, grease the pot really well or pour some melted butter or olive oil into the hot pot and tilt it to grease bottom. By the way, a silicone spatula works a treat when you tilt the dough into the super-hot pot!</direction>
      <direction>YET ANOTHER NOTE: the 3-cup-flour bread is ready at plus-minus 45 minutes. I have found that the 4-cup-bread needs a full hour.</direction>

    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>This recipe requires a simple prep.</direction>
      <direction>Prepare the onion, peel the garlic, chop the onion, peel and chop the 2 garlic cloves, chop the green chilies and jalapenos if you are using them and get the hominy drained and rinsed.</direction>
      <direction>I boil my ancho chilies in a separate small pot for the garnish part(read below).</direction>
      <direction>Now you are ready to cook.</direction>
      <direction>Place the meat in a large saucepan and just cover with lightly salted water.</direction>
      <direction>Add 1/2 chopped onion, the 2 cloves peeled garlic, pepper, cumin, and oregano.</direction>
      <direction>Bring to a boil over medium heat, skim off any foam that rises, reduce heat, cover and simmer for 45 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Remove meat and broth, reserving both.</direction>
      <direction>Saute the remaining chopped onion and garlic in oil until translucent.</direction>
      <direction>Add the remaining spices, stir for a minute.</direction>
      <direction>Cut the reserved pork into 1 inch cubes and add to the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Stir in the canned hominy, pork broth (if there is not enough pork broth, add chicken stock, I like to add it anyway for flavor, about 2-4 cups, eyeball the amount you like), green chilies and jalapenos (optional).</direction>
      <direction>Cook at a simmer, covered, for 45 to 60 minutes until the meat and hominy are tender.</direction>
      <direction>If necessary, cook for up to an additional 60 minutes until the chilies and onions are well blended into the broth.</direction>
      <direction>Degrease the stew, taste for salt, and serve in soup bowls.</direction>
      <direction>This is a delicious recipe and well worth the effort to make.</direction>
      <direction>Garnishes that are always served with are:.</direction>
      <direction>lots of lime/lemon wedges.</direction>
      <direction>sliced radishes.</direction>
      <direction>chopped cilantro.</direction>
      <direction>Shredded cabbage(not red).</direction>
      <direction>fresh/ packaged fried corn tortillas.</direction>
      <direction>When my ancho chilies are soft from boiling(takes about 15 minutes), then i put them in the blender with 1 1/2cups of water, 1 clove of garlic and about 2 tablespoons diced onion, and about 1 tablespoons of salt and pepper. I blend this thin, then strain it to get the liquid separated from its "pulp". I throw the pulp into the soup for the flavor i like but you can discard if too spicy for you. The remaining liquid you put in a serving dish for guests to add in their own bowl, if desired. Beware! It's HOT!</direction>

      <direction>To make BBQ Chicken: In a large frying pan, cook the chicken in olive oil over medium-high heat until just cooked, 5 to 6 minutes. Do not overcook. Set aside in the refrigerator until chilled through.</direction>
      <direction>Once chilled, coat the chicken with 2 tablespoons BBQ sauce; set aside in the refrigerator.</direction>
      <direction>To make the pizza: Place the pizza stone in the center of the oven and preheat to 500 degrees F for one hour before cooking pizzas.</direction>
      <direction>Use a large spoon to spread 1/4 cup BBQ sauce evenly over the surface of the prepared dough within the rim. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon smoked Gouda cheese over the sauce. Cover with 3/4 cup shredded Mozzarella. Distribute half the chicken pieces evenly over the cheese (approximately 18 pieces). Place approximately 18 to 20 pieces of red onion over the surface. Sprinkle an additional 1/4 cup Mozzarella over the top of the pizza.</direction>
      <direction>Transfer the pizza to the oven; bake until the crust is crisp and golden and the cheese at the center is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. When the pizza is cooked, carefully remove it from the oven; sprinkle 1 tablespoon cilantro over the hot surface. Slice.</direction>

      <direction>Place all the herbs, garlic, pepper, and butter in a small mixing bowl and beat with a wooden spoon until slightly fluffy.</direction>
      <direction>(you can do the mixing with a or food processor) Place a 12" square piece of plastic wrap or parchment paper on your work surface and mound the flavored butter in the center.</direction>
      <direction>Roll herb butter into cylinder shape within plastic, twisting the ends to compress the butter.</direction>
      <direction>Chill the butter in the refrigerator or freeze until firm.</direction>
      <direction>Butter will keep for up to 5 days in the refrigerator or up to 3 months in the freezer.</direction>
      <direction>Burger Preparation: Make hamburger patties as usual, but for each one place your thumb in the middle and press an indentation almost through (but not quite) to the other side of the meat.</direction>
      <direction>Unwrap formed butter and cut crosswise into 1/4-1/2" discs. (You will be using approximately 4 tablespoons Herb-Garlic Butter per 1 1/2 pound of ground meat).</direction>
      <direction>Form hamburger patty fully around one butter disc, pressing gently to seal the disc into the dead center of the meat.</direction>
      <direction>(not too much pressing! It will make your burgers dense and tough) Place burgers on hot grill (preheated to high if using a gas grill).</direction>
      <direction>Grill burgers until cooked to doneness, (about 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-done).</direction>
      <direction>Place burgers on a serving plate, add cheese, if desired, but do not serve for about 5 minutes, to allow flavors to fully meld.</direction>
      <direction>Brush buns with melted butter and toast on the grill for a few seconds.</direction>
      <direction>Serve with any toppings of your choice.</direction>

      <direction>Bring to a boil over high heat.</direction>
      <direction>As the drippings reduce they will darken.</direction>
      <direction>Pour in the remaining drippings until the liquid in the pan is as dark as you want.</direction>
      <direction>The amount of drippings will decrease, but the finished gravy will be darker and taste better without having to resort to something from a bottle.</direction>
      <direction>Remove browned drippings and Add enough stock to the drippings to measure 4 cups total cooking liquid.</direction>
      <direction>set aside Set the roasting pan on top of the stove over 2 burners on moderately low heat.</direction>
      <direction>Add 6 tablespoons of the reserved fat to the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle the flour into the pan, whisking constantly.</direction>
      <direction>Let the mixture bubble, whisking constantly, until it browns, 1 to 2 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>It is important to let the mixture cook for a minute or two to allow the flour to lose its raw taste, but adjust the heat as needed to keep it from burning.</direction>
      <direction>Whisk in the cooking liquid, scraping up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan.</direction>
      <direction>Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, whisking occasionally.</direction>
      <direction>If the gravy seems too thin, increase the heat to medium and boil until it is as thick as you wish.</direction>
      <direction>If desired, strain the gravy through a wire sieve to remove any extraneous bits of drippings.</direction>

      <direction>Spread the flour out on a plate and coat the beef cubes one by one in it, dusting off the excess.  Don't skip this step because the flour also helps to thicken the sauce at the end.</direction>
      <direction>Brown the beef in a heavy-bottomed pot in the oil over medium-high heat.  You want a lot of color on them because color equals flavor.</direction>
      <direction>Pour in all the spices, the tomato paste, and the water.  Bring this to a simmer, season with salt and pepper, and cook low and slow for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours until the beef is tender and falling apart.  A good test is to take a piece and try to mash it on your cutting board with a fork.  If it falls apart, you are golden.</direction>
      <direction>Serve it just by itself with mexican rice and refried beans or use it as a burrito filling.</direction>

      <direction>Heat peanut oil in a wok or large skillet over medium high heat.</direction>
      <direction>While pan is warming, toss the cold rice with your hands, making sure to separate the grains from any clumps.</direction>
      <direction>Add the garlic to the heated wok, and toss until fragrant and slightly golden.</direction>
      <direction>Add chicken, beef, or pork and stir fry for about 1 minute.</direction>
      <direction>Push the meat and garlic up the sides making a well in the middle and add eggs.</direction>
      <direction>Scramble eggs for 1 minute in middle of pan then, add green onions and peas and incorporate all ingredients together, stir frying for another minute.</direction>
      <direction>Add rice, turning over rice with pan ingredients several times to coat and stir frying for 2-3 minutes. You want the rice to begin to have a toasted smell, making sure that all the ingredients are constantly being moved around the pan for even cooking.</direction>
      <direction>If your pan seems to have cooled down to the point where the ingredients are no longer sizzling, you may need to turn the heat up slightly.</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle in the sugar and add the fish sauce and oyster sauce.</direction>
      <direction>Stir fry all ingredients together for one minute more or until sauces are absorbed and mixture is completely combined. Transfer to serving platter.</direction>

    <serving>1</serving>
    <list_ingredient>
      <ingredient>709.77 ml  white bread flour, not wholewheat (750 ml)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>2.46 ml  instant yeast</ingredient>
      <ingredient>2.46 ml  sugar</ingredient>
      <ingredient>9.85 ml  salt</ingredient>
      <ingredient>12-13 fluid ounce  water (415 ml, original recipe said 1 5/8ths cup, which was extremely difficult to get right)</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>*** Since first making this bread according to the original instructions (which caused a lot of mess), I've simplified the process. I have now bought a fairly deep plastic bowl with sloping edges, so it has a smallish bottom. The plastic seems almost -- not quite -- non-stick, and this is the method I use now:.</direction>
      <direction>In such a lightly greased plastic bowl, put the flour, and add the yeast, sugar and salt. You may want to add less salt, but we found the original amount (1 1/4 teaspoon) not enough. Mix through.</direction>
      <direction>Add the water and stir the lot through until well mixed to a nice, smooth, quite sloppy dough.</direction>
      <direction>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and put a kitchen terry towel or two over the top as well. Stand in a draught-free place for 18 hours.</direction>
      <direction>For me it works best to mix this up at 3pm. This means the dough is ready at 9am the next morning and I don't even have to get up early like my grandmother did to bake those huge farm loaves in the old days.</direction>
      <direction>After 18 hours the dough should be puffy and have little bubble holes on top and have more or less doubled in size, but don't worry too much about that.</direction>
      <direction>Instead of -- as the original recipe said -- turning out the dough on to a towel, do the following: From the sides of the bowl, scrape the dough away with light movements and fold it over on itself with floury fingers. Turn the bowl round and round, flattening the dough by repeating this "folding over". LIGHTLY press a little flatter.</direction>
      <direction>Cover bowl with same (now messy) plastic used before, and same terry towels.</direction>
      <direction>Leave to rise again -- 2 hours long.</direction>
      <direction>Half an hour before the 2 hours are up, put your oven on 450 deg F/220 deg Celsius. (I find that in my convection - fan - oven I can use a slightly lower heat: 215 - 210C, but the difference is not important).</direction>
      <direction>At the same time you need a heavy pot WITH a fitting lid, and this will go into the cold, heating-up oven, empty. The lid is to keep in the steam and cause that wonderful crust to form.</direction>
      <direction>Nothing beats an iron pot. Le Creuset will do too, and ceramic has been mentioned.</direction>
      <direction>I use a non-stick oval-shaped iron pot with a domed lid. You do NOT need a "6 - 8 quart pot" (sounds crazy to me) as stated in the original recipe. It's a small bread. My iron pot is a 2 1/2 quart pot, which translates to roughly 2 1/2 litres as well.</direction>
      <direction>I grease the pot and lid with REAL butter, and sometimes I slosh in some olive oil. I don't know why, but I feel I should do it. Now PUT THE POT IN THE OVEN, lid on.</direction>
      <direction>After the 2 hours of the 2nd rising, and when the oven and pot has reached its correct heat, take out that piping hot pot very carefully (I put it on one of my oven grids on a granite surface next to the oven).</direction>
      <direction>Have the covered dough nearby, and a silicone or other spatula. Tilt the plastic bowl over the smoking pot (don't let it touch the very hot pot) and with spatula or fingers scrape the dough lightly and evenly into the hot pot. It will sizzle as it falls into the pot; don't worry about that.</direction>
      <direction>Shake the pot slightly to distribute the dough, put on the lid, and carefully shove the whole shebang into the hot oven.</direction>
      <direction>Bake 30 minutes with lid, then open oven and take off lid. Bake 15 - 30 minutes more, until your bread has a golden crust. I find that about 15 - 20 minutes after taking off the lid the bread is ready. Baking times will differ because ovens differ.</direction>
      <direction>Turn out, and swallow that saliva until it's just cooled enough so you can saw off the end part to eat with real butter. On your own.</direction>
      <direction>When cold, do not put in plastic bag. Use a paper bag at most. I simply turn it on to the cut side on the breadboard, and cover it with a kitchen towel. It lasts until it's been eaten, which doesn't take long. Do not refrigerate, which would be silly.</direction>
      <direction>***A few points: 1. Z-mail me for questions 2. Your experience might be "messier" than mine; it depends on the consistency of the dough and the bowl you use. But greasing the bowl right at the start does help. 3. Keep to the hours mentioned. It's meant to be a sloooow rising process. 4. Be careful not to burn yourself! 5.I have just found, praise the angels, a wonderful, very fine stone-milled 100% organic flour, and have just put a loaf of that, for the first time, in the oven! I think this robust, Frenchified loaf just cries out for stone-milled flour, fine and creamy or almost white. 6. You could use 2 1/2 cups white bread flour + 1/2 cup fine rye flour. DO NOT USE wholewheat flour for this bread, except for maybe a handful: it does not have enough gluten for this bread.</direction>
      <direction>Good luck!</direction>
      <direction>And a warning, added months later: that pot you use MUST go into the oven empty, and must heat to the heat of the oven. I tried putting the dough in a cold pot yesterday, and the bread wasn't as successful. It didn't rise nearly as much, and didn't have that lovely artisanal cracked round top. So HEAT THE POT as instructed.</direction>
      <direction>MAKING A LARGER LOAF: The warning here is that I use my metric cups and spoons for this, which are very accurate! Fortunately I have a Pyrex measuring cup with both metric millilitres and Imperial fluid ounces, so I could measure the water absolutely equally.</direction>
      <direction>4 x 250 ml flour, or 1 litre or 4 cups (1 quart).</direction>
      <direction>3/4 teaspoon yeast, and stir into flour.</direction>
      <direction>3/4 teaspoon sugar, stir into flour.</direction>
      <direction>15 ml or 3 teaspoons salt.</direction>
      <direction>600 ml or 19 fluid oz water (JUST under 2 1/2 American cups -- maybe 2 teaspoons less than 2 1/2 cups).</direction>
      <direction>(EDITED June 2008): My husband actually calculated -- I'm bad with maths! -- that the water should be 666 ml  --  so add a dash more than 600 ml if you feel it's necessary. Just remember to bake this 2nd, larger recipe for the full hour. Also, he said the bread needed more salt. We don't eat a lot of salt and I'm not worried about the issue, so I now use 4 teaspoons, i.e. 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon).</direction>
      <direction>Best results are still with white bread flour, stone-milled, or all-purpose, and a little rye flour can be used too.</direction>
      <direction>Carry on as usual, grease the pot really well or pour some melted butter or olive oil into the hot pot and tilt it to grease bottom. By the way, a silicone spatula works a treat when you tilt the dough into the super-hot pot!</direction>
      <direction>YET ANOTHER NOTE: the 3-cup-flour bread is ready at plus-minus 45 minutes. I have found that the 4-cup-bread needs a full hour.</direction>

      <direction>Soak wooden skewers in warm water for 20-30 minutes prior to preparing food.</direction>

      <direction>Beat with a spoon until well mixed and the meat turns lighter in color.</direction>
      <direction>Take a handful of the mixture and form it around the skewer to approximately 6" long and 1" in diameter to make an elongated patty (it helps to oil hands, and lay out some wax paper to work on). If your meat is too wet to work with, as sometimes happens with too much onion or wet meat, it can help to just shape the kebabs on a piece of non-stick foil and grill them that way, on the foil, turning the kebab over as it cooks and comes together.</direction>
      <direction>Set kebabs aside on wax paper on another plate until ready to grill.</direction>
      <direction>Grill kebabs over hot coals or under broiler until cooked through, turning once.</direction>
      <direction>Serve with lemon wedges, and chelou (rice) with a sprinkling of sumak seasoning (optional).</direction>

    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Preheat oven to 425F; have ready a shallow baking pan that you've lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.</direction>
      <direction>Arrange chicken wings in prepared pan; lightly sprinkle both sides of wings with salt and pepper (go easy on the salt).</direction>
      <direction>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>While wings are in oven, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, ketchup, garlic powder and ginger; please note that the original recipe called for minced fresh garlic and minced fresh ginger, but I found they had a tendency to burn easily so went with the dried spices instead.</direction>
      <direction>Feel free to use two minced garlic cloves and 1 tsp of freshly minced ginger, instead of the dried spices, if you want to give fresh a go.</direction>
      <direction>After the wings have baked for 15 mins, remove from oven and drain off any accumulated fat.</direction>
      <direction>Pour the sauce over the wings and return to oven.</direction>
      <direction>Bake for 20 more minutes, turning wings over in sauce frequently (I do it every 4 or 5 minutes), so that they are thoroughly coated.</direction>
      <direction>Wings should be well glazed and sticky when done.</direction>

      <direction>Pour enough olive oil in a large sauce pan to cover the bottom, turn to medium high heat. This is the only pot you'll need for the sauce so it should be big. Soak the shrimp in milk and combine the dry ingredients (flour, 2T cheese, salt, pepper). Coat the shrimp with the dry ingredients and let them fry in the olive oil, About 2 minutes per side until golden brown. The Flour that falls off the shrimp will add great flavor and consistency to the sauce. Add more oil as necessary, between batches of shrimp.

      <ingredient>1.77 ml  oil</ingredient>
      <ingredient>28.39 ml chopped onion</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 garlic cloves, minced (I use 2 Tbls canned minced garlic)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>102.62 g can red enchilada sauce</ingredient>
      <ingredient>53.29 g can red enchilada sauce</ingredient>
      <ingredient>53.29 g container ricotta cheese</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 large  eggs</ingredient>
      <ingredient>7.09 ml  cilantro, finely chopped (another ingredient I have to hide)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>28.39 ml  cheddar cheese, shredded</ingredient>
      <ingredient>28.39 ml  monterey jack cheese, shredded (I use 1 pkg Mexican Blend Cheese)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>2  uncooked no-boil lasagna noodles</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Preheat oven to 375'.</direction>
      <direction>In a large skillet, cook onion and garlic in oil over medium heat until tender. Stir in enchilada sauce. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened, add chicken and stir to combine. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the eggs, ricotta cheese and cilantro.</direction>
      <direction>Spread 3/4 cup chicken mixture into a sprayed 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. baking dish. dollop ricotta mixture and cheese, Layer with three noodles, repeat chicken mixture and 1 cup shredded cheese. Top with remaining noodles, sauce and shredded cheese.</direction>
      <direction>Cover with foil and bake at 375deg for 30 minutes. Uncover; bake 10-15 minutes longer or until bubbly. Let stand for 10 minutes before serving.</direction>
      <direction>As a side dish, I make a tossed green salad and add chopped cilantro to compliment the taste.  Also serve with fresh french bread and butter or we eat it with Tortilla strips sometimes instead of bread. Yummy!</direction>
      <direction>Quick Tips: I buy a roasted chicken already cooked and cut it up. My family doesn't like onion so I use a grater to mince onion to make it so small they don't see it in the dish.  Also, I buy a pkg of Mexican Blend Cheese that already has two cups of the Cheddar and Jack.</direction>

      <direction>Preheat oven to 425F; have ready a shallow baking pan that you've lightly sprayed with nonstick cooking spray.</direction>
      <direction>Arrange chicken wings in prepared pan; lightly sprinkle both sides of wings with salt and pepper (go easy on the salt).</direction>
      <direction>Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>While wings are in oven, whisk together the soy sauce, honey, ketchup, garlic powder and ginger; please note that the original recipe called for minced fresh garlic and minced fresh ginger, but I found they had a tendency to burn easily so went with the dried spices instead.</direction>
      <direction>Feel free to use two minced garlic cloves and 1 tsp of freshly minced ginger, instead of the dried spices, if you want to give fresh a go.</direction>
      <direction>After the wings have baked for 15 mins, remove from oven and drain off any accumulated fat.</direction>
      <direction>Pour the sauce over the wings and return to oven.</direction>
      <direction>Bake for 20 more minutes, turning wings over in sauce frequently (I do it every 4 or 5 minutes), so that they are thoroughly coated.</direction>
      <direction>Wings should be well glazed and sticky when done.</direction>

    <list_direction>
      <direction>Place rack in upper third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees.</direction>
      <direction>Wash chicken inside and out with cold water, remove the giblets, then let the chicken drain, cavity down, in a colander until it reaches room temperature (about 15 min) Pat dry with paper towels.</direction>
      <direction>Pour lemon juice all over the chicken (inside and outside) season with salt and pepper.</direction>
      <direction>Prick the whole lemons three times with a fork and place deep inside the cavity.</direction>
      <direction>(Tip: If lemons are hard, roll on the countertop with your palm to get juices flowing.) Place the chicken breast-side down on a rack in a roasting pan, lower heat to 350 and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Remove from oven and turn it breast-side up (use wooden spoons!); return it to oven for 35 minutes more.</direction>
      <direction>Test for doneness - a meat thermometer inserted in the thigh should read 180, or juices should run clear when chicken is pricked with a fork.</direction>
      <direction>Continue baking if necessary.</direction>
      <direction>Let chicken cool for a few minutes before carving.</direction>
      <direction>Serve with juices.</direction>
      <direction>Serve with boiled new potatoes tossed with olive oil and fresh chopped parsley and/or steamed asparagus with butter.</direction>
      <direction>Enjoy.</direction>

      <direction>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; add squash and cook, stirring often, until it's starting to soften--about five minutes.  Add the onion and red pepper and cook for an additional 3 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Stir in apple, garlic, thyme, black pepper and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring, until apple is almost tender, about 2 minutes; stir in broth, scraping bottom of skillet with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits. Stir in cooked barley; toss over low heat to mix and coat. Remove from heat and serve. Yields about 1 cup per serving.</direction>
      <direction>*To make this vegetarian, use vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.</direction>

      <direction>If you see any take the feeder down and throw the bird food away.  It's not good for the birds to drink this.  Chances are they won't drink it anyway.</direction>
      <direction>Clean the hummingbird feeder by rinsing with warm water.  Then, put a few drops of bleach into the water inside the feeder and clean with a bottle brush.</direction>

      <direction>Brown the hamburger Cut velveeta into half-inch cubes and place in saucepan with 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes.</direction>
      <direction>Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until thorughly melted and blended.</direction>
      <direction>Stir the browned hamburger into the cheese sauce, then set sauce aside (NOTE: you may have to swat a few hands as they try to use your sauce for a dip).</direction>
      <direction>Completely, but lightly cover both sides of one tortilla with shortening (Don't be afraid to use your hands), then place the tortilla on a microwave-safe plate.</direction>
      <direction>Completely but lightly cover one side of the next tortilla and place it atop the first tortilla, shortening side up.</direction>

    <list_direction>
      <direction>Place the yeast, honey and warm water in a large bowl and let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>In a separate bowl, whisk together the salt and the flour. Use a wooden spoon to stir 2 cups of the flour mixture into the yeast mixture; stir in the remaining flour mixture (dough will be stiff).</direction>
      <direction>Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead with floured hands until dough is smooth and elastic, about 5-7 minutes. Add a little flour, 1 tablespoon at a time as necessary, to prevent dough from sticking.</direction>
      <direction>Place in an oiled bowl, turning once to coat. Cover with plastic wrap (or a clean kitchen towel) and leave to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.</direction>
      <direction>Preheat oven to 400F degrees.</direction>
      <direction>Gently punch dough down to deflate it and shape into two oblong baguettes. Dust tops lightly with flour and place on a lightly greased baking sheet; let rise uncovered for 30 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Use a serrated knife to cut 3-5 small diagonal slits across the tops of the baguettes, and lightly sprinkle with cool water.</direction>
      <direction>Bake in the middle of oven for 25-30 minutes, until golden. Transfer to a rack to cool.</direction>
      <direction>Best eaten the same day.</direction>

    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Place heavy bottom stock pot or dutch over over medium-low heat.
</direction>
      <direction>Add 1 Tbs cooking oil, 2Tbs butter to pot.
</direction>
      <direction>Add sliced onions and stir until they are evenly coated with the oil.
</direction>
      <direction>Cover and cook for about 20 minutes until they are very tender and translucent.
</direction>
      <direction>To brown or caramelize the onions turn heat under pot to medium or medium high heat.
</direction>
      <direction>Add 1/2 tsp sugar and 1 tsp salt and continue to cook uncovered, stirring frequently until the onions have browned and reduced significantly.
</direction>
      <direction>Once caramelized, reduce heat to medium-low and add 3 Tbs flour to the onions. 
</direction>
      <direction>Brown the flour for about 2-3 minutes trying not to scorch it. (If the flour does not form a thick paste, you can add a bit more butter here).
</direction>
      <direction>Stir in about 1 cup of warm stock, scraping the bottom of the pan to get up all of the cooked-on bits.
</direction>
      <direction>Add the rest of the stock, wine, sage, and bay leaf to the soup.
</direction>
      <direction>Simmer for 30 minutes.
</direction>
      <direction>To make the "croutes" (toasted bread), heat oven to 325 degrees F. 
</direction>
      <direction>Drizzle each side of the bread slices with a bit of olive oil and place on baking sheet.
</direction>
      <direction>Cook the croutes for 15 minutes in oven on each side (30 minutes total).
</direction>
      <direction>Check the soup for seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed.
</direction>
      <direction>Remove the bay leaf (if you can find it).
</direction>
      <direction>Transfer to a casserole dish.
</direction>
      <direction>At this point you can add the 2-3 Tbs cognac and grate the 1/2 raw onion into the soup.
</direction>
      <direction>Add a few ounces of the swiss cheese directly into the soup and stir.
</direction>
      <direction>Place the toasted bread in a single layer on top of the soup.
</direction>
      <direction>Sprinkle the rest of the cheese in a thick layer on top of the bread making sure to cover the edges of the toast to prevent burning.
</direction>
      <direction>Drizzle with a little oil or melted butter.
</direction>
      <direction>Place in a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes.
</direction>
      <direction>Turn on broiler and brown cheese well.
</direction>
      <direction>Let cool for a few minutes.

      <direction>Mince cranberries with a hand-blender, food-processor, or some kind of chopper.</direction>
      <direction>I use my Braun hand-blender, and the little cup it came with, which is used to chop things really small (rather than pureeing them, which the blender would probably do, if I used it without the cup).</direction>
      <direction>But you only fill it a 1/4 to a 1/2 full each time, or they won't be minced properly.</direction>
      <direction>(cranberries may be prepared up to 3 days in advance) In a bowl, mix the first four ingredients, and refrigerate for at least one hour, best if overnight.</direction>
      <direction>In the morning, or shortly before serving, whip the whipping cream until it peaks.</direction>
      <direction>Set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Add the marshmallows to the cranberry mixture, until thoroughly incorporated into the mix.</direction>
      <direction>Then slowly fold in the whipped cream, until it's completely mixed.</direction>
      <direction>Refrigerate until serving.</direction>

      <direction>Combine liquid marinade ingredients in a 2 cup heat proof measure, heat in the microwave (or in a pan of hot water) just enough to thin the honey, stir to combine, add spices, stir.</direction>
      <direction>Allow to cool.</direction>
      <direction>Meanwhile trim all fat from beef, slice up meat, place meat and marinade in a 1 gallon ziploc bag, remove all air from bag and refrigerate for 4 to 48 hours.</direction>
      <direction>Remove meat from marinade, drain in colander, reserve strained marinade!</direction>
      <direction>In a wok or large skillet over medium/high with teaspoon of sesame oil (just enough to coat pan when wiped with a paper towel) cook meat until lightly browned, stirring constantly.</direction>

      <direction>Cover and bring to a simmer.</direction>
      <direction>Cook until veggies are tender, about 5 minutes or until desired tenderness is reached, be sure to stir every few minutes after the first 5.</direction>

      <ingredient>4.53 g  butter, softened</ingredient>
      <ingredient>8.22 g  cream cheese, softened</ingredient>
      <ingredient>31.75 g  confectioners' sugar</ingredient>
      <ingredient>11.82 ml  peanut butter</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.24 ml  vanilla</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.09 ml  salt</ingredient>
      <ingredient>20.12-23.24 g  milk chocolate chips, for milk chocolate (almost 1 lg. bag) or 20.12 g  semi-sweet chocolate chips, for dark chocolate (almost 1 lg. bag)</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Mix the butter and cream cheese together. (I put mine in the microwave for 40 secs. to soften), then cream together.</direction>
      <direction>Add the confectionary sugar about 1 cup at a time, and mix well. (I use my hands to mix it all in).</direction>
      <direction>Add the peanut butter, vanilla, and salt, and mix until well-blended. (I use my hands to mix it all in).</direction>
      <direction>Place the mixture in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hours (I stick the bowl in the freezer for about 1/2 hr., to harden the dough.</direction>
      <direction>Form the peanut butter mixture into egg shapes, then refrigerate again for at least 1 hour (Again, I put them in the freezer instead of the fridge).</direction>
      <direction>Melt the chocolate in a microwave oven or in a double boiler. (I had better results using a double boiler, because the steaming water helps the chips to stay creamy longer).</direction>
      <direction>Quickly place the eggs, doing one at a time, in the chocolate mixture to coat the bottom, then lift it with a thin spatulda, and with a knife I spread all along the sides and top of the egg, then with the knife I fluff the top of the chocolate to make the eggs look pretty.  Just press down on the chocolate and lift up, with a butter knife.  Do it all over the top of the egg.</direction>
      <direction>You have to work quickly while the eggs are frozen, as the heat from the chocolate chips makes them soft again rather quickly.  If you notice them getting too soft, stick them back in the freezer for a few minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Arrange the chocolate coated eggs on a waxed paper lined tray, and allow the chocolate to harden. (I stick mine in the freezer for easier handling when coating with the chocolate).</direction>
      <direction>Place each peanut butter egg in a paper candy cup.</direction>
      <direction>You can decorate your eggs with pastel colored Easter sprinkles or pastel jimmies, found in the cake/decorating section at the grocery store.</direction>

      <ingredient>0.39 ml  pepper, we like pepper- reduce if you like</ingredient>
      <ingredient>1-1 medium  red potatoes, about the size of a lemon</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 green pepper, cut into strips</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 red onion, wedged</ingredient>
      <ingredient>37.70 g  mushrooms, cleaned</ingredient>
      <ingredient>1  bone in chicken breasts (1/2 to 3/4 lbs per breast) or 113.39 g  boneless skinless chicken breasts</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Combine first 7 ingredients and set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Spray a 10x13 pan with cooking spray and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. (Use a larger pan if you have it. The more room the stuff has to spread out the better it cooks).</direction>
      <direction>Rinse potatoes and cut into fourths. Leave skin on if you like. Place in pan.</direction>
      <direction>Add bell pepper strips, onion wedges and mushrooms to pan.</direction>
      <direction>Drizzle half the lemon juice mixture over veggies and toss to coat.</direction>
      <direction>Place chicken on top and drizzle the remaining lemon mixture on top and brush or rub into meat. I use the back of a spoon or my fingers.</direction>
      <direction>Bake until chicken is no longer pink in center basting after 15 minutes.</direction>
      <direction>Note: To reduce fat and calories reduce the olive oil as much as you desire and use boneless skinless chicken. Bake for 1 hr if using the bone in chicken.</direction>
      <direction>IMPORTANT:::: If the potatoes are still not DONE but the chicken IS --  Remove the chicken and cover with foil- keep warm --  Continue to cook the potatoes until done and return the chicken to the pan to serve --  This WILL keep the chicken from getting dry if the potatoes need extra baking time! AND you can toss the foil for no mess clean up!</direction>
      <direction>Use a stoneware pan if you have one. They conduct the heat better and the dish cooks faster. You may need to adjust the time if using a metal or glass pan.</direction>
      <direction>I always add more onions, peppers and mushrooms and get my pan WAY too full! Do not be tempted to do the same- I have found it works better to double the sauce and veggies when I want and cook them separately from the meat. Everything gets done faster and more evenly.</direction>

      <direction>Slowly add 1 cup of water with the processor running, once dough comes together process mix for 1 minute. 
</direction>
      <direction>Check dough, it will be slightly moist and sticky, add extra flour if needed and process for 30 seconds.
</direction>
      <direction>For loaves, divide dough in half and shape into 2- 11"-12" loaves( I usually hold it and squeeze gently starting in the middle and working towards the ends, letting it hang from my hands). Place on pan, and cut or snip 4 diagonal slashes into top of the loaf.
</direction>
      <direction>For rolls pinch off dough and form 24 balls place on cookie sheet. Snip a small slash into the top of each roll.
</direction>
      <direction>Set loaves or rolls in a warm spot to rise, rise for 40 - 60  minurtes for loaves, 30- 40 minutes for rolls, depending how warm your room is. 
</direction>
      <direction>As soon as you set you bread to rise, Preheat oven to 450 degrees, after 20 minutes place a shallow pan of warm water on the lower rack of you oven.
</direction>
      <direction>Bake for 10 minutes, lower temperature to 400 degrees bake 15 minutes more, check rolls at 10 minutes.
</direction>
      <direction>With the oven I have now, I have to remove the loaves from the pan turn them over and bake for 5 minutes more to get the bottom crusty, you may have to also.</direction>

      <ingredient>2 (603.27 g)  roasting chickens, each cut into 8 pieces</ingredient>
      <ingredient>78.07 ml  buttermilk</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 large  eggs, lightly beaten</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.83 ml  sweet paprika</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.83 ml  hot sauce</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.39 ml  fresh ground pepper</ingredient>
      <ingredient>1.62 ml  baking powder</ingredient>
      <ingredient>1.23 ml  baking soda</ingredient>
      <ingredient>196.36 ml  all-purpose flour (aprx. amount)</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0 to taste  vegetable oil, for frying (about a quart)</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup of the milk with 3/4 cup of kosher salt and the sugar and stir over moderate heat just until the sugar and salt dissolve, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a large, deep bowl and add the remaining 3 cups of milk. Add the chicken pieces and refrigerate for 4 hours. Drain the chicken, rinse and pat thoroughly dry. If you family or guests are salt sensitive be sure to wash the chicken thoroughly and pat very dry with paper towels.</direction>
      <direction>In a bowl, mix buttermilk, eggs, 1 tablespoon of kosher salt (or less, up to you - I use a teaspoon), paprika, hot sauce and pepper. Whisk in baking powder and baking soda. Put half of the flour in a large bowl. Working with a few pieces at a time, dredge the chicken in the flour, tapping off any excess. Dip the chicken in the buttermilk, letting the excess drip off; return the chicken to the flour and turn to coat. Transfer to a rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken, adding more flour as needed. If the flour becomes too lumpy, sift it.</direction>
      <direction>Heat the oil in 2 large, deep skillets until shimmering. Working in batches, add the chicken to the skillets in a single layer, without crowding, and fry over moderate heat. Cover for the first five minutes. Uncover and cook turning occasionally, until deep golden and cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should register 160deg.</direction>
      <direction>If it's frying too fast, reduce heat slightly. If it appears to retain grease, slightly increase heat.</direction>
      <direction>Drain the chicken on wire racks lined with paper towels and fry the remaining pieces. Serve hot or warm.</direction>
      <direction>NOTE: the key is to cover in the beginning to start the cooking process inside the chicken, but to uncover during the last part of the cooking time to get the outside nice and crispy and golden brown.</direction>

      <direction>Boil the scooped-out center part until very soft, about 10 to 12 minutes.</direction>

    <serving>0</serving>
    <list_ingredient>
      <ingredient>7.08 g  plain flour or 7.08 g  all-purpose flour</ingredient>
      <ingredient>1.98 g  sugar</ingredient>
      <ingredient>3.96 g  butter</ingredient>
      <ingredient>0.00 ml  salt (small)</ingredient>
    </list_ingredient>
    <list_direction>
      <direction>Sift/sieve the flour into a bowl and add the pinch of salt. Put aside for the moment.</direction>
      <direction>Make some space in the fridge, if necessary, for the bowl you're about to use in case you quickly need to chill the mixture.</direction>
      <direction>Using butter, grease the baking tray well and put it aside for the moment.  Yield for fingers (much preferred) is around a 7 to 8 inch square.  For Petticoat Tails it will yield a chunky 8 inch circle.</direction>
      <direction>Pre-heat the oven (Gas Mark 3 (325F / 165C degrees)).</direction>
      <direction>Put the butter (if using unsalted butter then ADD a pinch of salt to it) into a medium-size mixing bowl and mash it with a fork until it is soft and creamy without lumps. But don't let your hand heat warm it so much it starts to get runny. If you do, then put the bowl complete with butter &amp; fork into the fridge for 5 - 10 minutes to cool it, then take it out and mash quickly again until smooth and creamy with no lumps.</direction>
      <direction>Add the sugar and mix it in well, and quickly.</direction>
      <direction>Add the salted flour a VERY little at a time - mixing it in with the fork to start with, but do this quickly.</direction>
      <direction>Knead well (on a very lightly floured surface). I was advised: knead for several minutes, and that the longer you knead, the better the shortbread will be. I usually aim for kneading for anything up to 10 minutes as I was told to, but get fed up after 7 minutes and reckon it can't make THAT much difference! What is very important is: Don't allow the mixture to become too warm from your body heat whilst kneading. If it does, as before, put it into the fridge for a couple of minutes to chill it slightly before resuming. If you do find the need to chill it, as I often do on a hot day, then do knead it for at least a minute or so before rolling it.</direction>
      <direction>Something I should add despite the copious over-instruction here: I've never owned a rolling pin until a couple of days ago.  I don't know if using one will affect the texture, but I always used to pat it down as best I could with my palms.</direction>
      <direction>Roll the mixture out to shape and size of the tray.  For fingers, roll out to about 1/2 inch thick or perhaps even slightly thicker (this sounds awfully thick I know!, but it is important as if you go thinner it will affect the texture, and amazingly, the taste).  For petticoat tails it needs to be a little under 1/2 inch thick to yield a chunky circle of about 7 to 8 inches.</direction>
      <direction>For fingers: prick all over with a fork and put it into baking tray.  Do try to use one that can fit exactly, or one that at least three sides of the mixture fit snugly against, as any outer edges that don't butt right up against the sides of a tray tend to get a bit over-baked.</direction>
      <direction>For petticoat tails: using fork prongs, from the outer edge towards the centre, indent the top about a 1/2 inch all the way round to give it a nice crinkly edge - sort of like the teeth on a cogwheel, then prick all the way round the middle ideally rotating the fork or the pastry (or yourself!) to give a pretty effect when cut.  Carefully lift and support the decorated circle and place and fit snugly into the circular baking tray.  Score lightly (to about halfway downwards to bottom of the tray) into eight equal segments.</direction>
      <direction>Bake until golden brown for about 45 minutes at Gas Mark 3 (325F / 165C degrees). Do keep an eye on it! Petticoat tails seem to require a little less baking time. Hard to describe the colour to bake until. From experience I know what colour I'm looking for - you don't really want it to be undercooked, but when it's starting get a bit dark around the edges it's probably beginning to get a bit overdone already. Basically cook until it's just starting to darken round the edges then get it out quick and cool it - I usually place the hot tray on a very cold surface until cool.</direction>
      <direction>Whilst still quite warm in the tray, mark across and cut into finger-shaped pieces (if not making petticoat tails) - but leave them there in the tray, cut and together until fully cold.</direction>
      <direction>For petticoat tails it's customary to sprinkle liberally with castor sugar.</direction>
      <direction>Sorry to be such a pedant about this recipe!  I feel a bit like a mother hen clucking about "must do this -- ", "should do that -- " :)  But it is worth taking some care over as the resulting shortbread will be so good you'll be hassled to make it much more often by everyone you share the pieces with :).</direction>
      <direction>SERVING SUGGESTION:.</direction>
      <direction>Just on its own with a nice cup of tea or coffee, but also scrumptious on a plate with and/or dunked into a generous helping of creamy Cornish Dairy ice-cream and strawberries, jam (jelly) or fresh fruit.</direction>
      <direction>Personal Note:.</direction>
      <direction>I live an ultra low-fat, low-sugar (or at least low quantities of sugars at a hit), calorie-controlled lifestyle.  (I'm on maintenance these days rather than reduction - I don't think I dare get any leaner or people would worry!).</direction>
      <direction>Notwithstanding, I still make and eat pieces of this shortbread occasionally despite the fact that there's nothing remotely low fat, low-sugar or low calorie about it.  At least there's not much salt!</direction>
      <direction>You can make substitutions or add essences and flavourings and it'll probably work out fine but it won't be the same shortbread - it won't taste the same, it won't have the same texture, but the efforts you've put into making it (and clearing up afterwards) will have been the same. I reckon it's got to be worth trying it without substitutions first time around - you can always give the pieces that you know are much more than you really should be letting yourself scoff to friends and family who will bless you for it! And you don't NEED to eat them all at once! - they keep well in a biscuit tin or cookie jar in a cool, dark place for quite a long time (given half a  chance!). I guess you could probably freeze them too (if enough left!).</direction>
      <direction>ADDITIONS SUGGESTIONS:.</direction>
      <direction>Occasionally just for a change, right near the end of kneading I have added glace cherries, or occasionally sultanas or raisins, sometimes with and sometimes without cinnamon. Cherries worked ok, but wasn't crazy about the fruit. You could even split the kneaded mixture in two and do half plain and half with extra stuff then nudge them together in the baking tray for baking. I've never tried dessicated/flakes coconut or chunky milk/dark chocolate chips or crystallized (candied) ginger pieces perhaps with a bit of ground ginger in with the mix though I've often been tempted to - do let me know how they turn out if you do!</direction>
      <direction>I do know that dipping the tops from above at an angle into good quality melted real chocolate (not baking chocolate) so that the bottom remains uncoated and only half of the top is coated then leaving to cool (that's the tough bit!) is absolute heaven on earth in the eating.  It also occurred to me while choco-dunking one time to add some dessicated coconut into the chocolate first - but I didn't have any - bet it's nice though!</direction>
      <direction>Do enjoy and best wishes from England - and Scotland!</direction>

      <direction>(cranberries may be prepared up to 3 days in advance) In a bowl, mix the first four ingredients, and refrigerate for at least one hour, best if overnight.</direction>
      <direction>In the morning, or shortly before serving, whip the whipping cream until it peaks.</direction>
      <direction>Set aside.</direction>
      <direction>Add the marshmallows to the cranberry mixture, until thoroughly incorporated into the mix.</direction>
      <direction>Then slowly fold in the whipped cream, until it's completely mixed.</direction>
