    "## I/ Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooking recipes provide an interesting yet challenging test-beb for Machine Learning algorithms. In particular, interesting insights that can be gained from the analysis of cooking recipes are, e.g., the impact of various combinations of ingredients on dietary indicators or the rating that users attribute to recipes. Challenges arise due to the variety of ways in which recipes can be represented in a database and in the complexity of representing sequences of actions involving ingredients and their quantities. Also, the large number of possible ingredientsin a recipe makes the representation in the large dimension, and this generally posessome problems with Machine Learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## II/ Objectives / Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to design ways to represent recipes and apply some basic Machine Learning algorithms to solve some simple tasks such as classification of popular recipes. In particular, the project will identify web resources to access various recipes, will apply Natural Language Processing techniques to parse the recipes and create a database that will be processed using some basic Machine Learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the objectives of the project, the main tasks which need to be achieved are:\n",
    "+ Crawl - collect recipes from web sources\n",
    "+ Construct database schema for crawled data\n",
    "+ Apply some basic Machine Learning algorithms (optional)"

    "   2. Data source description: \n",
    "        + **FOOD.com** has nearly 20 million of users who access each month\n",

    "    \n",
    "    **This extensive amount of data is sufficient and necessary to feed to Machine Learning algorithms.**\n",

    "   3. Software, tools and libraries:\n",
    "        + **Selenium** Webdriver: WebDriver is designed to provide a simpler, more concise programming interface in addition to addressing some limitations in the Selenium-RC API. Selenium-WebDriver was developed to better support dynamic web pages where elements of a page may change without the page itself being reloaded. WebDriver’s goal is to supply a well-designed object-oriented API that provides improved support for modern advanced web-app testing problems. **=> Create a virtual web browser on python environment to access target sites**\n",
    "        + **BeautifulSoup**: is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree. **=> Parsing HTML content from target sites and  Construct an Element tree from parsed data. It is also used for manipulate, extract and access HTML content**"

    "1. The website is rendered by Javascript with __infinite scrolling__: At the beginning, my attempt is using Scrappy (which is also the scrapper framework, more popular than Selenium); unfortunately, this framework only allow to render the site once a time, which means the further content when we scroll the page is not visible to crawl. **Solution:** Instead of using Scrappy, I found that Selenium Webdriver has the ability to render interactive javascript page, which updates the HTML source when users interact with webpages\n",
    "2. **Request timeout** when crawling the links of recipes: Very naive, my intuition is collecting the links one by one at the main index page; my approach went well until I realized that the time for a user to access the page is roughly 120 mins. After that, the connection to the page will be shutdown automatically. **Solution:** I tracked the package that sends data from server to the page and started collecting data on its address.\n",
